# A Framework for Predicting RNA-Ligand Interaction

This is a pipeline developed for screening RNA-ligand interaction. This pipeline combines *ab initio* RNA structure prediction and geometric deep learning for large-scale RNA-Ligand interaction screen. Our approach predicts RNA 3D structures, trains a geometric deep learning-based scoring model, generates binding complex candidates, and systematically evaluates potential ligands. Uniquely tackling RNA-Ligand interactions in three-dimensional space without experimentally determined crystal structures, our pipeline offers atomic-level assessment and holds promise for advancing RNA-small molecule interaction understanding and RNA-targeted therapeutic design.
